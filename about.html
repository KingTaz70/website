        <p><br><br><br>I have been baking for a long time, sometimes just for fun but mostly because there was always some sort of occaision happening...,<br><br> <b>Birthdays, Aniversaries, Easter, Halloween, Christmas </b> <br><br>And because I have children, as do my friends and relatives I started to make more fun themed cakes.<br>
        When my friends saw that I was making, 3D or themed cakes for my family they started to ask if I could make one for them... and so it started.<br> <br> I'm just a Mum with a passion for baking and a family, that likes cake! <br> I hope that you like some of my designs and would like to share a slice, (or two), with your family and friends. <br><br> If so just go to the contact page and sellect your prefered option to get in touch.<br> <br> Take care now </p><br><br>
